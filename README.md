##Â How it works ?
In gateway and msapp directories, run this to generate applications :

    yo jhipster

Package both applications by running in those two directories :

    mvn package  docker:build
    
Go in docker-compose-config directory and run the jhipster docker-compose subgenerator :

    yo jhipster:docker-compose3

Run the registry first :

    docker-compose up -d jhipster-registry

Finally run the rest of the applications by running :

    docker-compose up -d
